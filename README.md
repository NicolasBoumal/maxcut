# Max-Cut
Optimization algorithms to compute approximate solutions to the Max-Cut problem

These are codes from circa 2016 used for the experiments in the following paper:

> N. Boumal, V. Voroninski and A. S. Bandeira,
> 
> The non-convex Burer-Monteiro approach works on smooth semidefinite programs,
> 
> in the [proceedings of NIPS 2016]([url](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2016/hash/3de2334a314a7a72721f1f74a6cb4cee-Abstract.html)).

We followed up with more theory in another paper:

> N. Boumal, V. Voroninski and A. S. Bandeira,
> 
> Deterministic guarantees for Burer-Monteiro factorizations of smooth semidefinite programs,
> 
> in [Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, 2019]([url](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpa.21830)https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpa.21830).
